since feeling is first
who pays any attention

will never wholly kiss you;

wholly to be a fool
while Spring is in the world

my blood approves,
and kisses are better fate

your eyelids' flutter which says

we are for each other; then
laugh, leaning back in my arms
for life's not a paragraph

And death i think is no parenthesis
